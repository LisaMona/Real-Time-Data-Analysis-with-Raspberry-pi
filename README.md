# Real-Time-Data-Analysis-with-Raspberry-pi

This repository contains the real-time data of an inbuilt temperature sensor in th R-pi 3B.
The data is stored in data_for_process.csv file and is read from that for drawing an interactive real-time plot.
The code for the same is written in the file temp_sensor.py


As an extension to the project, a Machine Learning model has been trained with the already exsiting data.
This logistic regression model learns from the data and predicts the output/results from the real-time sensor readings.
